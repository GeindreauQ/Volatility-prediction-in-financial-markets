- **Context** :

  - The American stock market is the most liquid equity market of the planet
     and hence provides many opportunities for investments. However, when 
    building a stock portfolio by combining financial assets, we need to 
    estimate its future risk, or volatility. The volatility of an asset is 
    loosely defined as the size of the variations of its price over a period
     of time: a price that doesn't change between the beginning and the end 
    of a period is more volatile if it fluctuates more during the period; a 
    price that changes smoothly has a higher volatility if its overall 
    change is large. There are multiple ways of capturing these two aspects 
    of volatility. The data uses a unique (but secret) definition. 
    Consequently, it is necessary to estimate the future risk of each 
    individual component of the portfolio. The past volatility of a stock is
     a good proxy of its future risk, but some intraday patterns remain to 
    be found with cutting edge algorithm. And, this is your challenge.

    CFM specializes in developing quantitative trading strategies and 
    building a portfolio from them. Controlling the risk of our client 
    investments is crucial, thus estimating the future risk of financial 
    assets is the cornerstone of our portfolio construction.

- ##### Challenge goals :

  - ##### Use past volatilities and price changes of financial instruments to 

    predict future volatility and control the risk of financial portfolios
